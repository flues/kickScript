# Feature: Table Side Tracking (Blue vs. White) âœ… FULLY IMPLEMENTED

## Status: âœ… Successfully Completed (January 2025)

**All planned features have been successfully implemented and are live.**

## Overview

This feature enables tracking of table sides in foosball matches to statistically analyze whether one side of the table offers an advantage. For every match, it is recorded which player played on which side (blue or white).

## Motivation

Many foosball players feel that one side of the table is stronger than the other. To statistically prove or disprove this, the side choice is now recorded for every match.
